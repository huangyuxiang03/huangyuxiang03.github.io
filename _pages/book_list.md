## 2024

- How Language Began [Translated to Chinese] by Daniel L. Everett \| 语言的诞生 丹尼尔·L.埃弗里特著

    A great book to rethink how language is generated during the evolution of human. Lots of good ideas can be grasped, and I would say that it is especially inspiring for people working on Natual Language Processing or Computational Linguistics. Although the author does not believe in that intelligence can be implemented by machines (which is what we are doing on LLMs), the book still contains lots of interesting views from archeologists, including the releationship between language and culture. I read this book on the flight (that's definitely a very long flight) to the first [COLM](https://colmweb.org/) conference, and it is a perfect match with Alice Oh's panel on Multilinguality during the conference, that lots of the theories among archeologists and computational linguistics are same, although they refuse to admit it :)

- The Worlds I See [In English] by Fei-fei Li \| 我眼中的世界 李飞飞著

    This is actually a very famous book in universities in Beijing (I believe it is also popular in other places in this world) now, written by the famous computer vision researher Fei-fei Li, who is a professor of Stanford Univerisity. Fei-fei shows her unique perspective towards American acedemia as a female immigrant born in Beijing, China and finished her immigration in her teens. She described the difficulty as both a female and an immigrant, and the aid she received to improve her studies all the way along, which is very touching. She also showed an authentic east-asian style of her origin family, which I believe every reader from such cultural environment should feel deeply related. (Personal advise: You should always check her google scholar page during reading this book. So you can know which paper or student she is refering to. :) )

- The Nile River begins to flow - true notes of a journalist stationed in Africa for 1,123 days [In Chinese] by Lyu Qiang \| 尼罗河开始流淌————驻非记者1123天真实手记 吕强著

    The author of this book, Lyu Qiang, is a journalist who has beed stationed in Africa for years and wrote this book after his return to China. The book provides a good view to Africa and Africaans, as it only describe and document the incidents that is happening in African contries, without making any comments. Readers are able to develop their personal opinions to such incidents without getting influence. The author mainly shows the difference among various regions and ethnics, which is affected to their culture and religious. In the last parts, the author focuses on the interactions of local residents and foriegn organizations e.g. UN forces and foriegn traders, deepening the topic of peace and urging to establish a newer, better international relationship.

- My Students in Second Tier University [In Chinese] by Huang Deng \| 我的二本学生 黄灯著

    In the past, Universities in China are officially devided into Tier 1, 2 and 3 Universities, where only the most prestigious schools, i.e. Tsinghua and Peking University, are classified into the Tier 1. Students in Tier 2 and 3 are expected to receive career education and the admission difficulty is lower compared to the tier 1 universities. The author of this book is a Chinese Literature Professor working in a tier 2 university in Guangdong Province, which is one of the richest provinces in China. This book shows what do second tier university students mainly concern about during the past 10 years, at the meantime exhibits the massive changes of Chinese society, i.e. the development of economy, the rise of housing price, and the differences occur in the HR market. This is good book for people who want to persue a research/educational career in universities, as it calls the readers to rethink the relationship of education and social needs.
