<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>

I am a 2nd year undergraduate student of Dept. of Computer Science and Technology of Tsinghua University, Beijing, PRC. My research interest is 
efficient computing, recently working on efficient large language models and parameter efficient tuning. 

- News: Welcom to read our new paper *CPET: Effective Parameter-Efficient Tuning for Compressed Large Language Models* ! It is mainly about combiniting PET methods with model compression and we developed a method to recover its performance drop.

- Recently I find taking notes with LaTeX is fun on maths or math-related cs courses, so I created this repository: [CourseNotes](https://github.com/huangyuxiang03/CourseNotes). If you are looking for some learning materials of THU CST courses, please reach to the repository. If you are also taking notes with LaTeX, just contact me!

- I speak Chinese and English and I am recently learning German (yes, I want to write Deutsch at first then I realized I'm writing English). You can contact me freely within Chinese or English. German... probably several years after then I could verstehe was du geschrieben :)
